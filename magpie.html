    <p>Dear Boulder Friends,<br><br>


Congratulations on cracking the code! We are getting married and are delighted to invite you to celebrate with us. In addition to inviting you to our wedding, we are also hoping you’ll join us for a pre-wedding one-night backpacking trip! Both of us initially envisioned getting married high up in the mountains, but ultimately decided we wanted to make our wedding more accessible, while still being on the edge of the mountains. However, we still wanted a chance to celebrate our relationship, our relationships to you, and our relationships with our high-elevation, alpine backyard. You might think of this backpacking trip as our analog to a bachelor/bachelorette party, and will take place in the mountains outside of Boulder a couple nights before the wedding (see general itinerary below). We understand that many of you have jobs etc. and so many not be able to join for this part, since it takes place during the week. 
<br><br>

</b> Note that among many other changes from a traditional wedding, this event will be vegan, zero waste, and alcohol-free. <br><br>
<b>RSVP <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDydM2bkb0PlZn5e8JIff9Bn09bXsCrsAO5O0o8tyPNCUzoA/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a> by April 1, 2024. </b>
Here are a couple of logistics to keep in mind, which will be updated as the event date gets closer:<br><br>

<b>Location:</b> <a href="https://harox.org/location">Boulder, Colorado</a>
<br><br>

 <ul>
 <li>Backpackers from out of town arrive in Boulder</li>
</ul>

 <li>Leave Boulder for backpacking trip at 7am-ish</li>
  <li>Spend the night camping in the mountains</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<b>Additional questions:</b>
<ul>
<li>If you are able to host guests from out of town in your extra bedrooms, couches, and tents in your backyards this would be super helpful for Wednesday night and/or Friday to Sunday </li>
<li>Some guests from out of town are also going to be staying at Chautauqua cottages. These cottages are massive and we’re hoping to borrow some air mattresses so that we can save people some money &mdash; if you have an air mattress, or extra bedding etc. sitting around, we would love to borrow them! </li>
<li>We are also looking for cars to drive for backpacking</li>
<li>We have never hosted a party this big, so if you enjoy helping out with any wedding preparation, we would love to hear from you! </li>
</ul>
