    <p>Dear Boulder Friends,<br><br>

Congratulations on cracking the code! We are getting married and are delighted to invite you to celebrate with us. We are so grateful to have been welcomed into your community in Boulder. We have both lived in many places, but have never before had such a fulfilling community as we do now: thank you for all the vegan potlucks, bluebird ski days (even the ones that ended in the hospital), jam sessions, paint nights, thoughtful discussions, bouldering hangouts, and game nights!<br><br>

</b> Note that among many other changes from a traditional wedding, this event will be vegan, zero waste, and alcohol-free. <br><br>
<b>RSVP <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRvCQdK068doImXu9ub8whVqw8rctK1Jyp9I4UL1hkmQB7Jg/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a> by April 1, 2024.</b> Here are some logistics that will also be covered in the RSVP form:<br><br>

<b>Location:</b> <a href="https://harox.org/location">Boulder, Colorado</a>
<br><br>
<b>Itinerary</b>:<br>
 <ul>
 <li>Friday, Sept 27 (optional)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Evening, dinner (picnic style)</li>
</ul>
<li>Saturday, Sept 28</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Morning, ceremony at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FfCvpFPLLrDTnQ9x5">Chautauqua Park</a></li>
  <li>Afternoon, lunch followed by games and activities</li>
    <li>Evening, reception</li>
</ul>
<li>Sunday, Sept 29</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Morning, brunch</li>
  <li>Afternoon, hike/walk/outdoor times (optional)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<b>Lodging:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>If you are able to host guests from out of town in your extra bedrooms, couches, and tents in your backyards this would be super helpful for Wednesday night and/or Friday to Sunday </li>
<li>Some guests from out of town are also going to be staying at Chautauqua cottages. These cottages are massive and weâ€™re hoping to borrow some air mattresses so that we can save people some money &mdash; if you have an air mattress, or extra bedding etc. sitting around, we would love to borrow them! </li>
<li>We are also looking for cars to drive for backpacking</li>
<li>We have never hosted a party this big, so if you enjoy helping out with any wedding preparation, we would love to hear from you! </li>
</ul>
