<b>RSVP:</b><br>
RSVP by May 15, 2024. To RSVP, click on the <a href='https://harox.org/rsvp'>RSVP</a> button above, and then type in the answer to Q6 from the emailed quiz (all lowercase), and press 'GO.'  If you need help, contact Harold or Roxanna.
<br><br>

<b>NB:</b> <br>Among many other changes from a traditional wedding, this event will be vegan, zero waste, and alcohol-free. We ask that you bring enthusiasm for novelty and  please respect these unusual norms. We will feel no hard feelings if you decide that this isn't the wedding for you.<br><br>
<b>Attire:</b><br>
For the ceremony and the reception, please dress very formal. What does this mean? Well, it may mean different things for different people. It could mean a tuxedo or a suit and tie, it could mean a very formal, fancy dress. Or it could be something completely different. It should be something that makes you feel special and that you only wear on special occasions; something that in its splendor matches the enthusiasm you have for celebrating our marriage. Attire that does not match traditional Western or gendered ideas of formal are welcomed. Also purple things are encouraged. Questions? Contact Harold or Roxanna. Also note that both events will be on grass, so wear shoes that work on squishy ground. <br>
For other events, we recommend clothes that you can be active in and shoes you can walk or run in. <br>

<b>Lodging information for out-of-towners:</b><br>
 Here are some lodging details that will also be covered in the RSVP form. We want to make our wedding accessible and affordable for everyone. We have a few options for where you can stay during our wedding, or you’re welcome to organize your own stay. 
<ul>
<li>Stay with our Boulder friends on their extra beds, couches, or a tent in their backyards. This is free.
 </li>
<li>We have reserved <a href="https://www.chautauqua.com/cottages-and-lodges/">Chautauqua cottages</a> for Friday Sept 27 to Monday Sept 30. There is a 3-night minimum requirement to reserve these cottages and each cottage has 2-3 bedrooms + an air mattress in a common space. Prices start at $340 USD for a queen size bed for the 3 nights. 
</li>
<ul>
<li>Note: If you would like to book an entire 1, 2, or 3 bedroom cottage prices are $830, $1024, $1260 for 3 nights including tax. </li>
</ul>
<li>There are many airbnbs and hotels near the wedding site that you can book for your stays, including <a href="http://www.boulderuniversityinn.com">Boulder University Inn</a> and <a href="https://footofthemountainboulder.com">Foot of the Mountain Motel</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Transportation information for out-of-towners:</b><br>
Boulder is easily reachable by <a href="https://app.rtd-denver.com/route/AB1/schedule?serviceType=3&direction=Westbound&branch=">bus</a> from the Denver International Airport (DEN). The ceremony is within easy walking distance of the hotels/cottages listed above. We hope that the reception will also be within walking distance, but we are still waiting for confirmation from the venue. It is likely that renting a car will not be necessary for out-of-town visitors. 
<br> <br>
<b>Additional information for Boulderites:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>If you are able to host guests from out of town in your extra bedrooms, couches, and tents in your backyards this would be super helpful for Friday to Sunday </li>
<li>Some guests from out of town are also going to be staying at Chautauqua cottages. These cottages are massive and we’re hoping to borrow some air mattresses so that we can save people some money &mdash; if you have an air mattress, or extra bedding etc. sitting around, we would love to borrow them! </li>
<li>We have never hosted a party this big, so if you enjoy helping out with any wedding preparation, we would love to hear from you! </li>
</ul>
