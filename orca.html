    <p>Dear Family and Friends,<br><br>

Congratulations on cracking the code! We are getting married and are delighted to invite you to celebrate with us. Although we do not currently live near you, you are all really important to us, and represent a key part of our community. Thank you for all of the shared memories, and we can't wait to make more! 
<br><br>
We have spent the past year thinking about what a wedding means to us, and we have decided to attempt to create a novel celebration that best represents who we are and what we want our lives to be. We are excited about the opportunity to have you be a part of it.
<br><br>
Among many other changes from a traditional wedding, this event will be vegan, zero waste, and alcohol-free. We understand that alcohol is a big part of the way many societies celebrate, but we envision a celebration filled with creativity and kindness that doesn’t rely on alcohol. We are planning many activities including hiking, orienteering, music, birding, dancing, and games to cultivate this experience. We understand that this is controversial, and we will not be offended if this event is not for you and you decide not to come; we still love you.
<br><br>
