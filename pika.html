    <p>Dear Family and Friends,<br><br>


Congratulations on cracking the code! We are getting married and are delighted to invite you to celebrate with us. In addition to inviting you to our wedding, we are also hoping you’ll join us for a pre-wedding one-night backpacking trip! Both of us initially envisioned getting married high up in the mountains, but ultimately decided we wanted to make our wedding more accessible, while still being on the edge of the mountains. However, we still wanted a chance to celebrate our relationship, our relationships to you, and our relationships with our high-elevation, alpine backyard. You might think of this backpacking trip as our analog to a bachelor/bachelorette party, and will take place in the mountains outside of Boulder a couple nights before the wedding (see general itinerary below). 
We understand that many of you have jobs etc. and so many not be able to join for this part, since it takes place during the week. 
<br><br>

</b> Note that among many other changes from a traditional wedding, this event will be vegan, zero waste, and alcohol-free. <br><br>
